##This summarises the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.

The data can be found at the following link.

The analysis generates a number of variables to read the individual text files into data tables.  

* activity
* features
* subData
* subTest
* subTrain
* xData
* yData
* xTest
* yTest
* xTrain
* yTrain

The script combines the data and filters for the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The output is saved into the **UCIdata** data frame.

A tidy data set is generated with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  This is saved into the **UCIdatatidy** data frame, and **UCIdatatidy.txt**.
